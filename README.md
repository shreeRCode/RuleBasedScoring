# Rule-Based Log Scoring

Rule-Based Log Scoring is a Python pipeline for ranking syslog-style network,
application, web, firewall, routing, identity, and system events. It combines
rule-based semantic parsing with Drain3 template mining, sliding-window
frequency, novelty scoring, event correlation, and configurable importance
thresholds.

The current entry point is `main.py`. It reads logs from `data/logs.txt`, scores
events, prints the top records and summary metrics, and writes the ranked output
to `output.txt`.

## Current Pipeline

`main.py` runs the active pipeline in this order:

1. Load `config/weights.yaml`.
2. Parse valid syslog lines from `data/logs.txt`.
3. Extract semantic `event_type` and `event_action` values from service/message rules.
4. Run Drain3 template mining and assign dynamic `TEMPLATE_<cluster_id>` IDs.
5. Fill missing `UNKNOWN` event types with the original service name.
6. Compute base features: severity, event-type score, confidence, frequency, and novelty.
7. Recompute frequency with `features.frequency.compute_frequency()`.
8. Recompute novelty with `features.novelty.NoveltyTracker`.
9. Compute event weight.
10. Correlate records by event family, host, event type/action, and time bucket.
11. Compute final importance score and label.
12. Print the top 10 logs, write `output.txt`, and print summary statistics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- PyYAML
- drain3

Install dependencies from inside `RuleBasedScoring`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional virtual environment setup on Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How To Run

Run from inside the `RuleBasedScoring` directory:

```powershell
python main.py
```

Default paths:

```text
Input logs:       data/logs.txt
Config file:      config/weights.yaml
Scored output:    output.txt
```

## Input Format

The parser expects lines in this form:

```text
<PRI>Mon DD HH:MM:SS HOST SERVICE: MESSAGE
```

Example:

```text
<191>Mar 12 10:00:00 fw-01 FW: connection allowed from 192.168.41.29
<187>Mar 12 10:00:00 app-server-01 APP: Service restarted
```

## Feature Scoring

Each `LogRecord` carries these active feature fields:

- `severity_score`
- `event_type_score`
- `event_type_confidence`
- `frequency`
- `novelty_score`
- `correlation_score`

Anomaly scoring is intentionally excluded from this rule-based version. That
signal should be generated dynamically by an ML or statistical detector, not
hard-coded from a CSV.

## Scoring Formulas

### Event Weight

```text
event_weight = (w1 * severity_score)
             + (w2 * event_type_score)
```

Defaults from `config/weights.yaml`:

```yaml
w1: 0.6
w2: 0.4
```

### Importance Score

```text
novelty_factor = 0.5 + 0.5 * novelty_score

weighted_event = alpha
               * event_weight
               * event_type_confidence
               * novelty_factor

novelty_bonus    = beta * novelty_score
correlation_term = gamma * correlation_score
rarity_term      = 0.3 * (1 / (1 + frequency))

importance_score = weighted_event
                 + novelty_bonus
                 + correlation_term
                 + rarity_term
```

## Labels

```text
score < 0.5        -> ignore
0.5 <= score < 1.0 -> low
1.0 <= score < 1.6 -> medium
1.6 <= score < 2.0 -> high
score >= 2.0       -> critical
```

## Notes

- Most stages mutate `LogRecord` objects in place.
- Frequency and novelty are order-sensitive.
- Config loading in scoring modules is cached.
- `main.py` currently computes correlation internally but does not write a separate cluster report file.
